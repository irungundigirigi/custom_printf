## get_function explained

function `get_func` that takes an argument `i` of type `char` and returns a function pointer. The function pointer points to a function that takes a `va_list` argument and returns a `char*` pointer.

Inside the `get_func` function, there is an array of `keys` which stores a mapping of characters to function pointers. Each element in the `keys` array is a structure that has two members:

1. `char`: a character representing a key.
2. Function pointer: a function pointer corresponding to the key, which takes a `va_list` argument and returns a `char*` pointer.

The functions `print_c`, `print_s`, are defined elsewhere in the code and are intended to implement different operations based on the character keys.

The last element in the `keys` array has a key of `'\0'` and a value of `NULL`, indicating the end of the array.

The purpose of the `get_func` function is to receive a character `i` as an argument, and based on the value of `i`, it should return the corresponding function pointer from the `keys` array. This allows the code calling `get_func` to dynamically determine which function to call based on the character key `i`. For example, if `i` is `'c'`, `get_func` would return a function pointer to the `print_c` function, if `i` is `'s'`, it would return a function pointer to the `print_s` function, and so on.
